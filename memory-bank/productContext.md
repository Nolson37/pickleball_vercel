## Scale Requirements
- Initial: 10-20 businesses (tenants)
- 1-year target: 100+ businesses
- Users per tenant: 100-1000 players
- Peak traffic: Evenings and weekends when most reservations are made

## Customization Requirements
- Start simple but design for extensive customization
- Custom branding for each business
- Unique workflows per business
- Feature toggles based on business model
- Long-term goal: AI assistant for business management

## Integration Requirements
- Multiple payment processors
- Email services
- SMS notifications
- Calendar integrations (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar)
- Future: Player AI agent for making reservations and finding courts
- Pickleball-specific integrations (ranking systems, community features)

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: Next.js, React
- Backend: Next.js API routes/serverless functions
- Deployment: Vercel
- Database: To be determined based on multi-tenant strategy

## Project Overview
Developing a scalable, multi-tenant SaaS platform using Next.js and deploying it on Vercel. The platform will support multiple organizations (tenants) accessing the same application instance while maintaining strict data separation.

## Key Requirements
- Multi-tenant data model and isolation strategy
- Authentication and authorization framework
- API design and service layer architecture
- State management approach
- Database schema and access patterns
- Deployment pipeline and environment configuration
- Tenant management system
- User management and role-based access control
- Subscription and billing integration foundation
- Monitoring and observability setup

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: Next.js, React, and supporting libraries
- Styling: CSS framework/approach (to be determined)
- Backend: Serverless functions, API routes, or dedicated services
- Database: Selection of appropriate database(s) for multi-tenant data
- Authentication: Auth provider integration (Auth0, Clerk, NextAuth, etc.)
- Infrastructure: Vercel deployment configuration and optimization
