## Multi-tenant Data Isolation

**Risk**: Insufficient data isolation between organizations could lead to data leakage between tenants.

**Impact**: High - Could result in serious privacy violations and loss of customer trust.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement comprehensive application-level filtering on all database queries
- Add automated tests specifically for multi-tenant data isolation
- Implement database-level row-level security as an additional safeguard
- Regular security audits and penetration testing focused on tenant isolation
- Add logging for all cross-tenant access attempts

## Authentication and Authorization

**Risk**: Vulnerabilities in the authentication system could allow unauthorized access to organization data.

**Impact**: High - Could lead to data breaches and unauthorized system access.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Use Auth.js (NextAuth) with proven authentication providers
- Implement proper JWT handling with organization context
- Regular security audits of authentication flows
- Implement proper RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) within organizations
- Add rate limiting and brute force protection

## Database Performance

**Risk**: As the number of tenants grows, database performance could degrade, especially for queries that span multiple tenants.

**Impact**: Medium - Could result in slower response times and poor user experience.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Proper indexing strategy, especially for organization ID columns
- Database query optimization and monitoring
- Consider read replicas for heavy read operations
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Plan for potential future sharding if necessary

## Scalability Limitations

**Risk**: The architecture may not scale effectively beyond a certain number of tenants or transaction volume.

**Impact**: Medium - Could limit business growth or require significant rearchitecting.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Design with scalability in mind from the beginning
- Regular load testing with projected growth scenarios
- Implement monitoring and alerting for performance metrics
- Have a clear scaling strategy documented for different growth scenarios
- Consider serverless architecture components where appropriate

## Deployment and CI/CD

**Risk**: Deployment issues could cause service disruptions or introduce bugs.

**Impact**: Medium - Could result in downtime or degraded service quality.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement comprehensive automated testing
- Use staging environments that mirror production
- Implement blue-green or canary deployments
- Automated rollback capabilities
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

## Third-party Service Dependencies

**Risk**: Reliance on external services (Vercel, Auth providers, etc.) introduces potential points of failure outside our control.

**Impact**: Medium - Could cause service disruptions if third-party services experience outages.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement circuit breakers for external service calls
- Have fallback mechanisms where possible
- Monitor third-party service health
- Maintain service level agreements with critical providers
- Document recovery procedures for third-party service failures

## Data Migration and Schema Evolution

**Risk**: As the application evolves, database schema changes could become complex and risky.

**Impact**: Medium - Could lead to data inconsistencies or migration failures.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Use Prisma migrations for controlled schema evolution
- Implement comprehensive testing for migrations
- Have clear rollback procedures for failed migrations
- Schedule migrations during low-traffic periods
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible

## Technical Risks

[2025-05-20 15:25:33] - ## Edge Runtime Compatibility Risks

**Date:** 5/20/2025

**Risk Identified:** Native Node.js modules in Edge Runtime

**Description:**
The project encountered issues with using native Node.js modules (specifically bcrypt) in Next.js middleware, which runs in Edge Runtime. Edge Runtime has limitations and doesn't support native modules that require node-gyp to build.

**Potential Impact:**
- Development environment failures
- Production deployment issues
- Security vulnerabilities if authentication is improperly implemented as a workaround

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Use Edge-compatible alternatives for native modules in middleware
2. Keep authentication logic that requires native modules in API routes rather than middleware
3. Document Edge Runtime limitations for the development team
4. Implement proper testing for middleware to catch these issues early
5. Consider using Web Crypto API for cryptographic operations in Edge Runtime

**Status:** Mitigated - Implemented a custom middleware solution that doesn't depend on native modules
