[2025-05-20 13:02:33] - ## Multi-Tenant Architecture Decisions

### Data Isolation Strategy
Decision: Use a shared database with organization ID approach rather than separate databases or schema-based isolation.
Rationale: Provides better resource utilization, simpler management, and easier cross-tenant operations while maintaining adequate isolation through row-level security policies.

### Authentication Provider
Decision: Use Clerk or Auth.js (NextAuth) with organization context in JWT tokens.
Rationale: These solutions integrate well with Next.js and Vercel, provide robust multi-tenant capabilities, and offer the flexibility needed for organization-specific customization.

### Database Technology
Decision: Use Vercel Postgres with Prisma ORM.
Rationale: Leverages Vercel's platform offerings for simplified management, provides relational data capabilities with JSONB for flexible schema, and offers strong type safety through Prisma.

### API Architecture
Decision: Use REST API with Next.js API routes and tRPC for type safety.
Rationale: Provides a familiar and straightforward API pattern with the benefits of type safety, while leveraging Next.js and Vercel's serverless functions.

### Implementation Approach
Decision: Start with a focused first slice for organization signup, then evolve incrementally.
Rationale: Allows for faster time to market with a foundation that supports the multi-tenant architecture, while enabling iterative development based on user feedback.

[2025-05-20 13:49:46] - # Decision: Deletion of Definition of Done Document

After reviewing both the Definition of Done (DoD) document and the Development Standards document, it was decided to delete the DoD document as it was deemed too rigid. The Development Standards document was considered sufficient to meet the project's needs without the additional rigidity imposed by the DoD document.

## Decision

[2025-05-20 13:53:59] - ## Documentation Structure and Version Control

Decided to create a dedicated 'docs' directory for all project documentation to improve organization and discoverability. The documentation is structured with:

- A main README.md in the project root that links to all documentation
- A documentation index (docs/index.md) that serves as a central hub
- Individual documentation files for specific topics

For version control, created a Git Configuration guide that outlines:

- Recommended .gitignore rules for documentation files
- Git attributes for proper handling of Markdown files
- Initial commit strategy and tagging
- Documentation branching strategy

This structure allows for easy navigation of documentation and ensures proper version control of documentation files.
[2025-05-20 15:25:09] - ## Node-gyp-build Error Resolution

**Date:** 5/20/2025

**Issue:** The Next.js development server was failing with a node-gyp-build error, specifically: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'modules')` in the node-gyp-build.js file.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. The error occurred in the middleware when it tried to use bcrypt, which is a native Node.js module.
2. Next.js middleware runs in Edge Runtime, which doesn't support native Node.js modules like bcrypt.
3. The auth.ts file was importing bcrypt for password comparison, and the middleware.ts file was importing the auth module, which indirectly imported bcrypt.
4. Additionally, the --turbopack flag in the dev script was exacerbating the issue.

**Solution:**
1. Removed the --turbopack flag from the dev script in package.json.
2. Replaced the auth middleware with a custom middleware implementation that doesn't depend on bcrypt.
3. The custom middleware still provides the necessary authentication functionality by checking for session cookies directly.

**Lessons Learned:**
1. Edge Runtime (used for Next.js middleware) has limitations and doesn't support native Node.js modules.
2. When using authentication in Next.js, be careful about what dependencies are used in middleware.
3. Always consider the runtime environment when importing modules, especially native ones.
4. Turbopack can sometimes cause compatibility issues with certain dependencies.

[2025-05-20 14:29:10] - # Architectural Decisions for Pickleball Facility Owner Platform

## Multi-tenant Data Model

**Decision**: Implement a shared database with organization ID approach for multi-tenant isolation.

**Rationale**: This approach provides a good balance between resource efficiency and tenant isolation. It allows for easier management of a large number of organizations while maintaining data separation through application-level filtering.

**Implications**: 
- Each table will include an organizationId column
- All queries must filter by organization ID
- Indexes on organizationId columns are required for performance
- Middleware will inject organization context into queries

## Authentication Framework

**Decision**: Use Auth.js (NextAuth) with JWT tokens containing organization context.

**Rationale**: Auth.js provides a flexible authentication solution that can be customized for multi-tenant scenarios. JWT tokens can store organization context, enabling efficient authorization checks.

**Implications**:
- Custom JWT token handling to include organization ID
- Next.js middleware for route protection and context extraction
- Role-based access control implementation

## Frontend Framework

**Decision**: Use Next.js 14+ with App Router, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.

**Rationale**: Next.js provides excellent server-side rendering capabilities and the App Router offers improved routing and layouts. Tailwind CSS enables rapid UI development, while shadcn/ui provides high-quality, accessible components.

**Implications**:
- Feature-based and domain-driven directory structure
- Component organization following shadcn/ui patterns
- Tailwind configuration for consistent styling

## Database Access

**Decision**: Use Prisma ORM with Vercel Postgres.

**Rationale**: Prisma provides type-safe database access with excellent developer experience. Vercel Postgres offers seamless integration with the Next.js deployment platform.

**Implications**:

## Workflow Adjustment

[2025-05-20 15:19:49] - # Development Environment Issue Resolution

We've encountered a critical blocker in our implementation process - a persistent node-gyp-build error that's preventing the Next.js development server from running properly. This issue emerged during the Authentication System Implementation subtask and is preventing us from fully testing and implementing the remaining components.

After analyzing the situation, I've decided to modify our workflow by adding a new subtask focused specifically on resolving this development environment issue. This task will be delegated to the Debug mode, which specializes in technical diagnostics and troubleshooting.

The revised workflow is:

1. Resolve Development Environment Issues (Debug mode) - NEW
2. Complete Authentication System Implementation (Code mode) - PENDING
3. Basic Dashboard Implementation (Code mode) - PENDING
4. Testing and Documentation (Debug mode) - PENDING

This approach addresses the immediate blocker while maintaining the logical sequence of our original plan. By resolving the environment issues first, we ensure a stable foundation for the remaining development work.

## Project Completion

## Incident Response Playbooks Design Decisions

[2025-05-20 19:41:11] - Decided to create a four-tier severity classification system (Critical, High, Medium, Low) for incidents based on industry best practices and the specific needs of a Next.js application on Vercel. This provides clear differentiation between incident types while remaining manageable.

Defined six core roles for the incident response team (Incident Commander, Technical Lead, Communications Lead, Operations Lead, Security Lead, Business Stakeholder) to ensure all aspects of incident response are covered while maintaining clear responsibilities.

Created six distinct incident type playbooks (Application Outages, Database Issues, Performance Degradation, Security Incidents, Data Integrity Issues, Third-Party Service Disruptions) to address the most common and critical incident scenarios for the application.

Incorporated decision trees into each playbook to guide the response team through complex scenarios, ensuring consistent decision-making during high-pressure situations.

[2025-05-29 13:50:53] - ## [2025-05-29] File Structure Analysis - README.md and package.json Duplication

**Issue**: User questioned whether duplicate README.md and package.json files in root vs web/ directory were normal or should be consolidated.

**Analysis**: After comprehensive examination of both file pairs:
- Root level serves as project orchestration layer (Docker, global dependencies, project-wide docs)
- web/ directory serves as application implementation layer (Next.js app, dev tooling, app-specific docs) 

**Decision**: KEEP current structure - this is architecturally appropriate
- Root package.json: Global dependencies (@vercel/analytics, @vercel/speed-insights)
- Web package.json: Complete Next.js application dependencies (29 prod + 27 dev deps)
- Root README.md: Project-wide documentation, Docker deployment focus
- Web README.md: Application-specific documentation, development focus

**Rationale**: This follows modern monorepo patterns with clear separation of concerns. Structure supports multiple deployment methods and future expansion.

**Outcome**: No changes needed - structure is intentional and well-designed.
