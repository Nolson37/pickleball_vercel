[2025-05-20 13:02:45] - ## Multi-Tenant Architecture Patterns

### Shared Database with Discriminator Column
Pattern: Using a shared database with an organization ID column in each table to isolate tenant data.
Implementation: PostgreSQL with row-level security policies and organization ID foreign keys.
Benefits: Efficient resource utilization, simplified management, easier cross-tenant operations.

### Middleware-based Tenant Context
Pattern: Using middleware to extract and propagate tenant context throughout the request lifecycle.
Implementation: Next.js middleware that extracts organization ID from JWT tokens and adds it to the request context.
Benefits: Consistent tenant context across the application, simplified service layer, reduced risk of data leakage.

### Tenant-Aware Caching
Pattern: Incorporating tenant identifiers in cache keys to maintain isolation in cached data.
Implementation: SWR or React Query with organization-specific cache keys.
Benefits: Improved performance without compromising tenant isolation, efficient resource utilization.

### Feature Flag Configuration
Pattern: Using tenant-specific configuration to enable/disable features and customize behavior.
Implementation: Configuration table with JSON/JSONB columns for flexible storage, cached for performance.
Benefits: Ability to customize the application per tenant without code changes, simplified feature rollout.

### Adapter Pattern for Integrations
Pattern: Using adapters to abstract external service integrations and handle tenant-specific configurations.
Implementation: Service adapters for payment processors, email services, calendar systems, etc.
Benefits: Simplified integration management, ability to swap providers, tenant-specific integration settings.

## Multi-tenant Architecture Pattern

**Pattern**: Shared Database with Tenant ID

**Description**: This pattern uses a single database instance with tenant identification columns in each table to isolate tenant data. All queries include tenant ID filtering to ensure data isolation.

**Implementation**:
- Organization ID column in all tenant-specific tables
- Application-level filtering in data access layer
- Indexes on organization ID columns for performance
- Middleware to inject organization context into queries

## Repository Pattern

**Pattern**: Repository

**Description**: The Repository pattern abstracts the data access logic from the business logic. It provides a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects while hiding the details of data access implementation.

**Implementation**:
- Repository interfaces for each domain entity
- Implementation classes that handle data access details
- Organization context injection in repository methods
- Centralized error handling and logging

## Middleware Pattern

**Pattern**: Pipeline

**Description**: The Middleware pattern creates a pipeline of processing steps for handling requests. Each middleware component performs a specific function and passes the request to the next component in the pipeline.

**Implementation**:
- Next.js middleware for authentication and authorization
- Organization context extraction from JWT tokens
- Route protection based on user roles and permissions
- Error handling and logging middleware

## Context Provider Pattern

**Pattern**: Provider

**Description**: The Context Provider pattern makes data available to all components in a component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

**Implementation**:
- Organization context provider for global access to current organization
- Theme provider for dark/light mode support
- Authentication context for user session information
- Nested providers for component-specific contexts

## State Management Pattern

**Pattern**: Flux/Redux-like

**Description**: This pattern centralizes state management with unidirectional data flow. State changes are triggered by actions and processed by reducers or similar mechanisms.

**Implementation**:
- Zustand stores for complex state management
- Actions for triggering state changes
- Selectors for accessing specific parts of the state
- Middleware for side effects (e.g., API calls)

## Service Layer Pattern

**Pattern**: Service Layer

**Description**: The Service Layer pattern defines an application's boundary and its set of available operations from the perspective of interfacing client layers. It encapsulates the application's business logic and controls transactions.

**Implementation**:
- Service classes for each domain entity
- Business logic encapsulation
- Transaction management
- Integration with external services
