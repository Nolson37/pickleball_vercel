## Overview

This document outlines the security considerations for the Pickleball Facility Owner Platform. It defines the security architecture, multi-tenant isolation mechanisms, authentication and authorization approaches, data protection strategies, and security best practices to ensure a secure and compliant platform.

## Multi-tenant Security Architecture

### Tenant Isolation

**Application-Level Isolation**

The platform uses a shared database with tenant isolation through organization IDs. This approach requires robust application-level security controls:

1. **Query Filtering**: All database queries include organization ID filtering to ensure data isolation.
2. **Middleware Protection**: API routes use middleware to enforce organization context.
3. **Authorization Checks**: All data access includes authorization checks based on user roles within the organization.
4. **Input Validation**: Strict validation of organization IDs in all requests.

**Example Query Filtering**:

```typescript
// Example of organization-scoped query with Prisma
async function getFacilities(organizationId: string) {
  return prisma.facility.findMany({
    where: {
      organizationId: organizationId, // Ensures data isolation
    },
  });
}
```

### Organization Context Management

1. **Session-Based Context**: Organization context is stored in the user's session.
2. **JWT Claims**: Organization ID is included in JWT tokens for API authentication.
3. **Context Switching**: Users can switch between organizations they belong to.
4. **Default Organization**: Users have a default organization selected after login.

**Example JWT Payload**:

```json
{
  "sub": "user_123456",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "organizationId": "org_789012",
  "roles": ["admin"],
  "iat": 1621234567,
  "exp": 1621238167
}
```

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Strategy

1. **Auth.js (NextAuth) Integration**: Leveraging Auth.js for secure authentication.
2. **Multiple Providers**:
   - Email/Password authentication
   - OAuth providers (Google, Microsoft, etc.)
   - Magic links for passwordless authentication
3. **Session Management**:
   - JWT-based sessions
   - Secure, HTTP-only cookies
   - Appropriate token expiration
4. **MFA Support**: Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations.

### Authorization Model

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Predefined roles (Admin, Manager, Staff, etc.)
   - Role assignment at the organization level
   - Permission sets associated with roles

2. **Permission Structure**:
   - Resource-based permissions (e.g., `facilities:read`, `facilities:write`)
   - Administrative permissions (e.g., `users:manage`, `billing:manage`)
   - Organization-wide permissions (e.g., `organization:settings`)

3. **Authorization Checks**:
   - API-level authorization middleware
   - Component-level access control
   - Data-level filtering based on permissions

**Example Authorization Check**:

```typescript
// Example of permission-based authorization check
function canManageFacility(user: User, facilityId: string): boolean {
  // Check if user has admin role or facility management permission
  return (
    user.roles.includes('admin') ||
    user.permissions.includes('facilities:manage')
  );
}
```

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling

1. **Data Classification**:
   - Public data: Organization name, public facility information
   - Internal data: User profiles, facility details
   - Sensitive data: Contact information, financial data
   - Highly sensitive: Authentication credentials, API keys

2. **Data Encryption**:
   - Data at rest: Database encryption
   - Data in transit: TLS/SSL encryption
   - Sensitive fields: Field-level encryption for highly sensitive data

3. **PII Protection**:
   - Minimization of collected PII
   - Secure storage of necessary PII
   - Access controls for PII data

### Data Retention and Deletion

1. **Retention Policies**:
   - Clear retention periods for different data types
   - Automated data archiving
   - Compliance with relevant regulations

2. **Deletion Mechanisms**:
   - Soft deletion for recoverable data
   - Hard deletion for permanent removal
   - Cascading deletion for related records

3. **Organization Termination**:
   - Clear process for organization account closure
   - Data export options before deletion
   - Complete removal of organization data

## API Security

### API Protection Mechanisms

1. **Authentication**:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - API key authentication for service-to-service communication

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Per-user rate limits
   - Per-organization rate limits
   - Graduated response to excessive requests

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Schema-based validation for all requests
   - Sanitization of user inputs
   - Protection against injection attacks

4. **Output Filtering**:
   - Removal of sensitive data from responses
   - Appropriate error messages
   - Pagination for large result sets

### API Security Headers

```typescript
// Example of security headers middleware
export function securityHeaders() {
  return [
    {
      key: 'X-DNS-Prefetch-Control',
      value: 'on',
    },
    {
      key: 'Strict-Transport-Security',
      value: 'max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload',
    },
    {
      key: 'X-XSS-Protection',
      value: '1; mode=block',
    },
    {
      key: 'X-Frame-Options',
      value: 'SAMEORIGIN',
    },
    {
      key: 'X-Content-Type-Options',
      value: 'nosniff',
    },
    {
      key: 'Referrer-Policy',
      value: 'origin-when-cross-origin',
    },
  ];
}
```

## Frontend Security

[2025-05-20 18:20:08] - # Security Hardening for Next.js Production Deployment

Implemented the following security hardening measures for the Next.js application:

## API Route Security

1. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Created a rate limiting middleware in `src/lib/rate-limit.ts`
   - Implemented in-memory store for rate limiting with configurable limits
   - Added specific rate limiting for authentication endpoints (5 requests per minute)
   - Added general API rate limiting (60 requests per minute)
   - Applied rate limiting to the register route

2. **CSRF Protection**:
   - Ensured CSRF protection is applied to sensitive routes
   - Applied CSRF protection to the register route
   - Removed skipCSRFCheck from NextAuth configuration

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Verified that input validation is already implemented using Zod schemas

## Security Headers

1. **Content Security Policy**:
   - Added CSP header to vercel.json
   - Configured strict CSP policy to prevent XSS attacks

2. **CORS Configuration**:
   - Added CORS headers to middleware.ts
   - Implemented origin validation based on ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable
   - Added proper Access-Control-Allow-* headers

3. **Other Security Headers**:
   - Verified existing security headers in vercel.json (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security)

## Environment Variables

1. **Environment Variable Validation**:
   - Created env-validation.ts utility for validating required environment variables
   - Implemented validation in auth.ts to ensure all required variables are set
   - Added validation for URL and port environment variables

2. **Environment Variables Example**:
   - Created .env.example file with all required environment variables
   - Added comments to explain each variable

These security measures help protect the application against common vulnerabilities such as CSRF, XSS, CORS misconfiguration, and rate limiting attacks.
