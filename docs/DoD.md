## Introduction

### Purpose and Scope

This Definition of Done (DoD) document defines the criteria that must be met before a feature, user story, or task is considered complete. It provides clear, measurable outcomes that can be verified by both human developers and AI coding agents. The DoD ensures consistent quality across all deliverables and helps maintain the integrity of the Pickleball Business Management SaaS Platform.

### Relationship to Development Standards

This DoD complements the Development Standards document by focusing on the verification and validation aspects of the development process. While the Development Standards document defines how code should be structured and organized, this DoD defines when a feature or task is considered complete and ready for release.

## Manual Testing Requirements

### Standard

Code must be manually tested to verify functionality, usability, and integration with other components before being considered complete.

### Verification Methods

- **Shell Commands**: Use available CLI tools to verify functionality and behavior

- **Manual Testing**: Conduct hands-on testing to verify user experience and edge cases

### Acceptance Criteria

- All user-facing functionality has been manually verified
- Edge cases and error conditions have been tested
- Cross-browser compatibility has been verified (if applicable)
- Mobile responsiveness has been tested (if applicable)
- Accessibility requirements have been verified
- Performance has been manually assessed
- Integration with other components has been verified
- Manual testing results are documented

## Test Coverage Requirements

### Standard

Code must have comprehensive automated test coverage to ensure reliability, maintainability, and regression prevention.

### Verification Methods

- **Unit Tests**: Verify individual components in isolation
