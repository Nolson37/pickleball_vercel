## Post-Incident Review Process

### Scheduling the Review

1. **Timing**:
   - SEV1: Schedule within 1 business day of resolution
   - SEV2: Schedule within 3 business days of resolution
   - SEV3: Schedule within 5 business days of resolution
   - SEV4: Optional, at the discretion of the Incident Commander

2. **Participants**:
   - Required: All members of the incident response team
   - Recommended: Engineering leadership, Product representatives
   - Optional: Other stakeholders as appropriate

3. **Preparation**:
   - Incident Commander prepares a draft timeline
   - Technical Lead prepares technical analysis
   - All participants review the draft materials before the meeting

### Conducting the Review

1. **Ground Rules**:
   - Blameless: Focus on systems and processes, not individuals
   - Constructive: Focus on learning and improvement
   - Inclusive: Ensure all voices are heard
   - Thorough: Dig deep into root causes

2. **Agenda**:
   - Introduction and ground rules (5 minutes)
   - Timeline review (15 minutes)
   - Technical deep dive (20 minutes)
   - Impact assessment (10 minutes)
   - What went well (10 minutes)
   - What could be improved (15 minutes)
   - Action items (15 minutes)
   - Wrap-up (5 minutes)

3. **Facilitation Techniques**:
   - Use the "5 Whys" technique to identify root causes
   - Encourage participation from all attendees
   - Keep the discussion focused on learning, not blame
   - Document all insights and action items

### Documenting Findings

1. **Post-Incident Report**:
   - Complete the post-incident report template
   - Include all relevant details from the review
   - Share with all participants for feedback
   - Finalize and publish to the knowledge base

2. **Action Items**:
   - Clearly define each action item
   - Assign owners and due dates
   - Categorize by type (Prevention, Detection, Response)
   - Prioritize based on impact and effort

## Preventive Measures Implementation

### Categorizing Action Items

1. **Prevention**:
   - Actions that prevent similar incidents from occurring
   - Examples: Code fixes, architecture changes, process improvements

2. **Detection**:
   - Actions that improve detection of similar incidents
   - Examples: New monitoring, improved alerting, enhanced testing

3. **Response**:
   - Actions that improve response to similar incidents
   - Examples: Playbook updates, training, tool improvements

### Prioritization Framework

| Priority | Impact | Effort | Timeframe |
|----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| P0 | Critical (could cause another SEV1) | Any | Immediate (within 1 week) |
| P1 | High (could cause a SEV2) | Low/Medium | Short-term (within 2 weeks) |
| P2 | High (could cause a SEV2) | High | Medium-term (within 1 month) |
| P3 | Medium (could cause a SEV3) | Low/Medium | Medium-term (within 1 month) |
| P4 | Medium (could cause a SEV3) | High | Long-term (within 3 months) |
| P5 | Low (could cause a SEV4) | Any | Long-term (within 3 months) |

### Implementation Process

1. **Planning**:
   - Break down action items into specific tasks
   - Estimate effort and resources required
   - Schedule work in appropriate sprint(s)
   - Communicate plans to stakeholders

2. **Execution**:
   - Implement changes according to priority
   - Follow standard development processes
   - Document changes thoroughly
   - Update relevant documentation

3. **Tracking**:
   - Track progress in issue tracking system
   - Review progress in regular team meetings
   - Escalate blockers as needed
   - Report status to stakeholders

## Follow-up and Verification

### Verification Process

1. **Testing**:
   - Develop tests to verify preventive measures
   - Consider chaos engineering tests for critical fixes
   - Verify monitoring and alerting improvements

2. **Review**:
   - Conduct peer reviews of implemented changes
   - Verify documentation updates
   - Ensure monitoring is properly configured

3. **Validation**:
   - For critical changes, consider staged rollout
   - Monitor closely after implementation
   - Validate that the issue is fully resolved

### Effectiveness Review

Schedule a follow-up meeting 1-3 months after implementing preventive measures to:

1. **Assess Effectiveness**:
   - Review metrics related to the incident area
   - Determine if preventive measures are working
   - Identify any gaps or new issues

2. **Adjust as Needed**:
   - Refine implemented solutions
   - Address any new issues discovered
   - Update documentation and playbooks

3. **Celebrate Success**:
   - Recognize team members who contributed
   - Share success stories with the broader organization
   - Build confidence in the incident response process
