# Glossary of Terms

This glossary provides definitions for terms used in our production deployment and testing strategy.

## A

### A/B Testing
A method of comparing two versions of a feature to determine which one performs better. Users are randomly assigned to either the A (control) or B (variant) group, and metrics are collected to compare the performance of each version.

### Alerting
The process of notifying team members when certain conditions or thresholds are met, indicating potential issues that require attention.

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

### Approval Workflow
A process that requires manual approval from designated team members before certain actions (such as production rollbacks) can be executed.

### Automated Testing
The process of using software to execute tests automatically, comparing actual outcomes with expected outcomes.

## B

### Blue-Green Deployment
A deployment strategy that maintains two identical production environments, with only one active at a time. This allows for zero-downtime deployments by switching traffic from the blue environment to the green environment.

### Branch
A parallel version of a repository that allows you to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.

### Build
The process of converting source code into an executable application.

## C

### Canary Deployment
A deployment strategy that releases a new version to a small subset of users before rolling it out to the entire user base. This allows for testing in production with minimal risk.

### Chaos Engineering
The practice of intentionally introducing failures into a system to test its resilience and identify weaknesses.

### CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)
A software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production.

### Circuit Breaker
A design pattern that prevents cascading failures by stopping the flow of requests to a service that is likely to fail.

### Configuration
Settings that control how an application behaves, typically stored in environment variables or configuration files.

## D

### Database Migration
The process of making changes to a database schema, such as adding or modifying tables, columns, or constraints.

### Deployment
The process of releasing a new version of an application to an environment.

### Development Environment
An environment used for ongoing development and initial testing of new features.

### Down Migration
A database migration that reverses the changes made by an up migration, allowing for rollback of database changes.

## E

### Environment
A set of infrastructure and configuration that hosts an application, such as development, staging, or production.

### Error Rate
The percentage of requests or operations that result in errors.

## F

### Feature Flag
A technique that allows features to be enabled or disabled without deploying new code. Also known as feature toggles.

### Feature Flag Targeting
The process of enabling a feature flag for specific users or user segments based on attributes such as role, location, or behavior.

## H

### Health Check
A mechanism for verifying that a service is functioning correctly, typically by making a request to a specific endpoint.

## I

### Incident
An unplanned interruption or degradation of service that requires a response.

### Incident Classification
The process of categorizing incidents based on severity, impact, and other factors to determine the appropriate response.

### Incident Response
The process of detecting, analyzing, and resolving incidents.

### Integration Testing
Testing that verifies the interaction between different components or services.

## L

### Load Testing
Testing that evaluates how a system performs under expected or heavy load conditions.

### Logging
The process of recording events, messages, and data during the execution of an application.

## M

### Metrics
Quantitative measurements of system performance, behavior, or health.

### Middleware
Software that acts as a bridge between different applications or components, often used for routing, authentication, or logging.

### Migration
The process of moving data or schema from one state to another, typically in the context of databases.

### Monitoring
The process of collecting and analyzing data about system performance and behavior to detect issues and trends.

### Multivariate Flag
A feature flag that can have multiple values or variants, rather than just being on or off.

## P

### Percentage Rollout
A feature flag strategy that gradually increases the percentage of users who have a feature enabled.

### Performance Testing
Testing that evaluates the speed, responsiveness, and stability of an application under various conditions.

### Production Environment
The environment that serves the application to end users.

### Progressive Delivery
A deployment strategy that gradually releases new features to users, monitoring for issues and rolling back if necessary.

## R

### Response Time
The time it takes for a system to respond to a request.

### Rollback
The process of reverting to a previous version of an application or database when issues are detected.

### Rollout
The process of gradually releasing a new feature or version to users.

## S

### Smoke Test
A basic test that verifies that the most critical functions of an application are working correctly.

### Staging Environment
An environment that mirrors production and is used for final testing before deploying to production.

### System Resilience
The ability of a system to maintain acceptable performance levels in the face of failures or disruptions.

## T

### Testing Framework
A set of tools, libraries, and practices used to create and execute tests.

### Traffic Routing
The process of directing user requests to different versions or instances of an application.

### Traffic Shifting
The process of gradually increasing or decreasing the percentage of traffic sent to a specific version or instance of an application.

## U

### Unit Testing
Testing that verifies the functionality of individual components or functions in isolation.

### User Segment
A group of users who share certain attributes or behaviors, often used for targeting feature flags or A/B tests.

## V

### Vercel
A cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions that enables developers to deploy websites and web services.

### Version
A specific iteration of an application, typically identified by a version number or tag.
