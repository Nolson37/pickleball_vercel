## Introduction

### Purpose and Scope

This document defines the standards and acceptance criteria for development approach and code organization. It provides clear, measurable outcomes that can be verified by both human developers and AI coding agents. This document complements the Definition of Done (DoD) by focusing on how code should be organized and developed.

### Relationship to Definition of Done

While the Definition of Done (DoD) document defines when a feature or task is considered complete, this document defines how code should be structured and organized. The standards defined in this document should be applied throughout the development process to ensure that code meets the quality criteria specified in the DoD.

## Coding Execution Requirements

### Standard

- Code is developed in small iterations, focusing on atomic changes that can be independently verified. Manual verification of code should be conducted as we go to ensure that code is working as expected before moving on and before writing comprehensive tests.
- All code is has complete automated test coverage developed after manual verification of code.

### Verification

- Shell Commands
- Playwright MCP
- Manual Testing
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- End to end tests

### Acceptance Criteria

- Code is executed in a way that is AI friendly and enables AI to to review code as part of it's workflow to develop working code.

## Project Structure and File Organization

### Standard

Project structure follows a consistent, logical organization that promotes discoverability, maintainability, and scalability.

### Verification

- Directory structure analysis
- Project structure validation
- File organization linting

### Acceptance Criteria

- Project follows a feature-based or domain-driven directory structure
- Maximum directory nesting depth is 5 levels
- Related files are grouped together
- Configuration files are centralized in a dedicated directory
- Public API definitions are separated from implementation details
- Test files are co-located with the code they test
- Assets are organized by type and purpose
- Build and deployment scripts are in a dedicated directory
- Third-party dependencies are clearly separated from application code

## Coding Standards and Style Guidelines

### Standard

Code follows consistent style guidelines and adheres to best practices for readability, maintainability, and performance.

### Verification

- ESLint/TSLint for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Stylelint for CSS/SCSS
- Prettier for code formatting
- Automated code quality checks in CI/CD pipeline

### Acceptance Criteria

- All code passes linting with zero errors
- Code formatting is consistent across the codebase
- Cyclomatic complexity is below 10 for all functions
- Cognitive complexity is below 15 for all functions
- Maximum nesting depth is 4 levels
- Functions have a single responsibility
- No duplicate code (DRY principle)
- No dead code or commented-out code
- No known performance anti-patterns

## Naming Conventions

### Standard

Names are descriptive, consistent, and follow established conventions for the language and framework being used.

### Verification

- Naming convention linters
- Automated naming analysis tools
- Code reviews with naming checklist

### Acceptance Criteria

- All names are descriptive and unambiguous
- Names follow language-specific conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case)
- Variables, functions, and classes have meaningful names that reflect their purpose
- Abbreviations are only used if they are universally understood
- Naming patterns are consistent throughout the codebase
- Domain-specific terminology is used appropriately
- No generic names like "Manager", "Processor", "Handler" without context
- File names match the primary export/component they contain
- Directory names reflect their purpose or domain

## Component Architecture and Modularization

### Standard

Code is modularized with clear component boundaries, following principles of high cohesion and loose coupling.

### Verification

- Dependency analysis tools
- Component coupling metrics
- Architecture conformance testing

### Acceptance Criteria

- Components have a single responsibility
- Dependencies between components are minimized
- Circular dependencies are eliminated
- Implementation details are encapsulated
- Interfaces are well-defined and documented
- Components can be tested in isolation
- Business logic is separated from presentation logic
- Infrastructure concerns are separated from domain logic
- Components follow established architectural patterns

## State Management and Data Flow

### Standard

State management follows a consistent, predictable pattern with clear data flow and appropriate state isolation.

### Verification

- State management linting rules
- Data flow analysis tools
- State mutation tracking

### Acceptance Criteria

- Frontend state management uses a unidirectional data flow
- UI component state is isolated to the component when appropriate
- Application-wide state is managed through a centralized store
- Backend state management uses appropriate patterns (transactions, CQRS, etc.)
- State mutations are traceable and predictable
- Side effects are isolated and managed
- Asynchronous operations follow consistent patterns
- State is persisted appropriately based on requirements
- Cache invalidation strategies are clearly defined

## Error Handling and Logging

### Standard

- Errors are handled consistently and appropriately, with meaningful error messages and comprehensive logging.
- Error handling and logging implementations are AI friendly and enable AI to to review logs and errors as part of it's workflow to develop working code.

### Verification

- Error handling linting rules
- Log analysis tools
- Error simulation testing

### Acceptance Criteria

- All errors are caught and handled appropriately
- Error messages are clear and actionable
- Errors include relevant context for debugging
- Logging uses appropriate levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Logs include correlation IDs for request tracing
- Sensitive information is not logged
- Structured logging format is used for machine parsing
- Error boundaries are implemented for UI components
- Standardized error response format is used for APIs

## Documentation Standards

### Standard

Code and APIs are well-documented with clear, concise, and up-to-date documentation.

### Verification

- Documentation coverage tools
- API documentation validators
- Documentation linting

### Acceptance Criteria

- All public APIs have comprehensive documentation
- Documentation includes parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Code includes comments explaining "why" not just "what"
- Complex algorithms and business rules are documented
- Architecture decisions are documented
- Documentation is kept up-to-date with code changes
- Documentation follows a consistent format
- API documentation includes examples
- Documentation is accessible and searchable

## Version Control Workflow

### Standard

Version control follows a consistent workflow that promotes collaboration, code quality, and traceability.

### Verification

- Branch policy enforcement
- Commit message validation
- Pull request analysis

### Acceptance Criteria

- Branching strategy follows established patterns (GitHub Flow, Git Flow, etc.)
- Commit messages follow conventional commits format
- Pull requests include description, context, and linked issues
- Code is reviewed before merging
- CI/CD pipeline validates changes before merging
- Feature branches are short-lived
- Main branch is always in a deployable state
- Release process is clearly defined and automated
- Version tagging follows semantic versioning
