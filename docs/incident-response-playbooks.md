## Introduction

These incident response playbooks are designed to provide clear, actionable guidance for responding to various types of incidents that may occur in our production environment. They integrate with our existing rollback mechanism, production testing framework, and feature flag system to provide a comprehensive incident response strategy.

The playbooks are structured to guide the response team through the entire incident lifecycle, from detection and assessment to resolution and post-incident review. They include decision trees to help navigate complex scenarios, communication templates to ensure consistent messaging, and detailed procedures for specific incident types.

## Incident Response Framework

Our incident response framework consists of five main components:

1. **[Incident Classification System](./incident-classification-system.md)**: Defines severity levels, classification criteria, and response time expectations.

2. **[Response Team Structure](./response-team-structure.md)**: Defines roles, responsibilities, escalation paths, and communication protocols.

3. **Incident Response Procedures**: Step-by-step procedures for different incident types, available as individual playbooks.

4. **[Communication Templates](./communication-templates.md)**: Templates for internal and external communication during incidents.

5. **[Post-Incident Procedures](./post-incident-procedures.md)**: Templates and processes for post-incident reviews and implementing preventive measures.

## Playbook Components

Each incident type playbook includes the following components:

1. **Incident Definition**: Clear definition of the incident type and potential severity levels.

2. **Detection Methods**: How to detect the incident, including automated monitoring and manual reports.

3. **Initial Assessment**: Steps for confirming the issue, assessing severity, and assembling the response team.

4. **Diagnostic Procedures**: Detailed procedures for diagnosing the issue, including code snippets and commands.

5. **Resolution Strategies**: Strategies for resolving the issue, including quick mitigation, rollback procedures, and long-term fixes.

6. **Verification Steps**: Steps for verifying that the issue is resolved.

7. **Decision Tree**: A flowchart to guide decision-making during the incident.

8. **Communication Templates**: Specific templates for the incident type.

9. **Post-Incident Tasks**: Tasks to complete after the incident is resolved.

## Available Playbooks

### Core Playbooks

1. **[Application Outage Playbook](./playbooks/application-outage-playbook.md)**: For incidents where users are unable to access or use the application or its critical features.

2. **[Database Issues Playbook](./playbooks/database-issues-playbook.md)**: For incidents affecting the database's availability, performance, or data integrity.

3. **Performance Degradation Playbook**: For incidents where the application is experiencing significant performance issues.

4. **Security Incidents Playbook**: For incidents involving security breaches, vulnerabilities, or attacks.

5. **Data Integrity Issues Playbook**: For incidents involving data corruption, inconsistency, or loss.

6. **Third-Party Service Disruptions Playbook**: For incidents caused by disruptions in third-party services.

### Supporting Documents

1. **[Incident Classification System](./incident-classification-system.md)**: Defines severity levels and response expectations.

2. **[Response Team Structure](./response-team-structure.md)**: Defines roles and responsibilities.

3. **[Communication Templates](./communication-templates.md)**: Templates for various communication needs.

4. **[Post-Incident Procedures](./post-incident-procedures.md)**: Procedures for after an incident is resolved.

## Integration with Existing Systems

These playbooks integrate with our existing systems:

### Rollback Mechanism Integration

The playbooks reference and leverage our [rollback mechanism](../rollback-mechanism-design.md), which includes:

- Automatic detection of issues based on thresholds
- Manual approval workflow for production rollbacks
- Procedures for application code, database, and configuration rollbacks

### Production Testing Framework Integration

The playbooks incorporate our [production testing framework](../web/docs/production-testing-framework.md), which provides:

- Smoke tests for verifying core functionality
- Load tests for assessing performance under load
- Chaos engineering tests for validating system resilience
- A/B testing infrastructure for testing feature variations

### Feature Flag System Integration

The playbooks utilize our [feature flag system](../web/docs/feature-flag-system.md) for mitigation strategies:

- Disabling problematic features without deploying new code
- Enabling fallback features during incidents
- Gradually rolling back features that cause issues
- Targeting fixes to specific user segments

## Maintenance and Updates

These playbooks should be maintained and updated regularly:

1. **Regular Reviews**: Review all playbooks quarterly to ensure they remain current.

2. **Post-Incident Updates**: Update relevant playbooks after each incident to incorporate lessons learned.

3. **System Changes**: Update playbooks when significant changes are made to the application, infrastructure, or supporting systems.

4. **Drills and Exercises**: Conduct regular drills to test the effectiveness of the playbooks and identify areas for improvement.

5. **Feedback Loop**: Establish a process for collecting feedback from the response team and incorporating it into the playbooks.
